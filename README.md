# Immigrants-of-Catana

An electronic version of Settlers Of Catan, this pass and play version supports 2-4 players on a single device. 
All protocols and edge cases are strictly enforced in code, so even begginers at the game do not need to worry about breaking any rules!

Implemented using object-oriented Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and driven by both asynchronous functions and button click events.
